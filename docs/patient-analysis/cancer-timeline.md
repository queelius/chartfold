# Complete Cancer Timeline — Alexander Towell

## The Silent Years (pre-2020)

No medical records exist before September 2021. Patient was uninsured and never
saw a doctor. However, lab work at first presentation tells the story:

- **Ferritin: <1 ng/mL** (normal male: 30-400) — iron stores completely depleted
- **Hemoglobin: 7.1 g/dL** (normal: 13-17.7) — critically anemic, ~half normal
- **Occult blood: positive** in stool

This level of iron depletion doesn't happen overnight. Ferritin <1 represents
**years** of chronic blood loss. The sigmoid colon mass (6.0 cm at resection)
was almost certainly growing and bleeding for multiple years before diagnosis.
The tumor was circumferential and had already invaded through the visceral
peritoneum (pT4a) — this degree of invasion takes significant time.

**Key insight**: The late presentation due to lack of insurance access likely
allowed what may have started as a localized polyp to progress to a T4a tumor
with serosal penetration — which is the mechanism by which it likely seeded
the peritoneum and eventually the terminal ileum.

## 2024 — Recurrence: Ileal Tumor + Liver Metastases

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 17 | Port-A-Cath removal (presumed end of treatment era) |
| Apr 26 | CEA: 1.9, Hgb: 10.9 (anemic again), Ferritin 5.09 (very low again) |
| May 7 | Hgb 11.5, CT abdomen/pelvis |
| May 8 | CT progress note: **sclerotic focus in left iliac bone** noted again — "nonspecific given history of malignancy, comparison with prior studies or evaluation with MRI or bone scan if clinically indicated" |
| May 22 | **Bone scan** performed (whole body nuclear medicine) |
| May 29 | **Colonoscopy** — ulcerated lesion in terminal ileum |
| May 29 | **Pathology (AS24-3099)**: Terminal ileum — moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. MMR panel: MLH1+, MSH2+, MSH6+, PMS2+ (all intact = MSS) |
| Jun 30 | CEA: 3.0 (at upper limit of normal) |
| Jul 1 | **Right hemicolectomy** (Dr. Chung, hand-assisted laparoscopic) — palpable mass in terminal ileum with mesenteric lymph node spread |
| Jul 2 | **Pathology (AS24-3810)**: |
| | - Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in ileum |
| | - Invades through muscularis propria into pericolonic tissue |
| | - Perineural invasion: **present** |
| | - Lymphovascular invasion: not identified |
| | - **5 tumor deposits** |
| | - **4 of 14 lymph nodes positive** |
| | - **Deep/radial margin positive** (serosal stricture site) |
| | - No precursor lesion in ileal mucosa |
| Jul 8 | Ferritin 27.8 |
| Jul 22 | Port-A-Cath insertion (new port for chemo) |
| Jul 25 | **PET/CT**: At least 4 hypermetabolic liver lesions (segments II, VII, VIII) + 2 hypermetabolic soft tissue nodules in rectovesical pouch — metastatic disease |
| Aug 12 | Start FOLFIRI/bevacizumab Cycle 1 |
| Aug 15 | Consultation with Dr. Tan (BJH/Wash U) to discuss HAI pump therapy |
| Aug 16 | Malignant neoplasm metastatic to liver diagnosis (Epic) |
| Aug 20 | **Washington University pathology consult** (Dr. Byrnes) — reviewed all Anderson pathology |
| Aug 22 | **Dr. Byrnes' critical observation**: "The bulk of the tumor appears to arise in the perienteric soft tissue. No precursor lesion or adenoma identified in the background ileum. Morphologically similar to the previous colonic primary. These findings could represent a new ileal primary. However, there is concern that this could represent a new metastasis or spread from the prior colonic primary, which was previously pT4a and had penetrated the serosa." |
| Aug 28 | **MRI Abdomen/Pelvis**: Vague hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions in segments 2, 4A, 7 — likely treatment response. Treated rectovesicular pouch lesions without residual metastatic disease. |
| Sep 17 | Dr. Tan discusses tumor board recommendations: resection vs transplantation vs systemic therapy alone vs HAIP (hepatic arterial infusion pump) |
| Oct 15 | CT scan |
| Oct 23 | **CT outside consult (BJH)**: Liver lesions much smaller. Stable 8mm solid nodule right lower lung lobe (indeterminate). Stable 7mm groundglass nodule left lower lobe. |
| Nov 14 | Progress notes: discussing repeat PET and MRI |
| Nov 21 | **PET/CT**: Resolution of 4 hypermetabolic liver lesions and rectovesicular pouch lesions. Persistent indeterminate activity in right hilar region. |
| Nov 29 | **MRI liver**: Posttreatment changes with decrease in size. Segment 2 lesion now 7mm (was 2.3cm). Ill-defined segment 8 changes possibly focal hepatic toxicity from oxaliplatin. |

**Staging revised: Stage IV (T4a N2b M1b — liver + peritoneal)**

## 2025 — Liver Resections + Continued Systemic Therapy

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Mar 12-13 | CT scan |
| Apr 30 | **MRI liver**: Segment 2 lesion unchanged at 7mm. No new metastatic disease. Near complete resolution of segment 8 oxaliplatin toxicity. |
| May 2 | Hgb 15.2 (recovered), TSH 6.65 (still elevated) |
| May 14 | **Liver resection #1** — Segment 2 (Dr. Chapman, BJH, robotic-assisted) |
| May 14 | **Pathology**: Metastatic adenocarcinoma, morphologically compatible with colorectal primary. **Adenocarcinoma present at cauterized resection margin. Perineural invasion identified.** |
| Jun 30 | CEA: 5.8 (spike post-surgery) |
| Jul 8 | CEA: 4.7, **Tempus XF liquid biopsy**: 523-gene panel — inconclusive, no reportable pathogenic variants, TMB 2.2 (low), MSI-High not detected |
| Jul 10 | **Tempus xT tissue test ordered** from liver specimen (Block A1) |
| Aug 8 | Second Tempus xT request |
| Aug 13 | **Tempus xT results returned** (per addendum — content may be in PDF attachment) |
| Aug 13 | **MRI Abdomen/Pelvis**: Postoperative segment 2. No residual enhancing mass. No new suspicious mass. No evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. |
| Aug 13 | **PET/CT**: No evidence of new metastatic disease. Indeterminate right suprahilar lymph node (stable). Non-FDG avid bilateral lung nodules (stable). **Diffuse persistent left hemithyroid activity — recommend thyroid function tests.** |
| Aug 14 | TSH 3.48 (improved on levothyroxine 125 mcg) |
| Sep 11 | CEA: 4.0 |
| Sep 25 | CEA: 3.8 |
| Oct 9 | CEA: 3.3 |
| Oct 23 | CEA: 4.1 |
| Nov 6 | CEA: 2.9, CT Chest: Stable lung nodules, no disease progression |
| Nov 9 | **MRI Abdomen/Pelvis**: **2 NEW hepatic segment 4A/8 lesions** (1.2 cm and 0.6 cm) — suspicious for metastatic disease |
| Nov 19 | **PET/CT**: Subtle uptake in area of segment 4A lesion — "may represent metastasis versus physiologic artifact" |
| Nov 20 | CEA: 2.6 |
| Dec 18 | **Liver resection #2** — Segments 5/8 and 4B (Dr. Chapman, BJH, robotic-assisted) |
| Dec 18 | **Pathology**: Both specimens: Metastatic moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with necrosis. **Both margins negative for carcinoma.** |

## 2026 — MRD Assessment + New Regimen

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 15 | **MRI Abdomen/Pelvis**: Postsurgical changes from resection, postoperative collections. **No new enhancing hepatic lesion.** |
| Jan 15 | **CT Chest**: Stable pulmonary nodules (9mm RLL, LLL). No new metastatic disease. |
| Jan 15 | CEA: 1.8 (continuing decline) |
| Jan 15 | **Guardant360 liquid biopsy**: |
| | - **Tumor fraction: <0.05% (MRD-negative)** |
| | - MSI-High: Not detected |
| | - TMB: Not evaluable (too little ctDNA) |
| | - **BRCA1 promoter methylation detected** |
| Jan 15 | Dr. Tan discusses 3 options: (1) Observation, (2) Adjuvant FOLFOX, (3) FOLFOX/panitumumab. Patient wants to await Guardant results. |
| Feb 5 | CEA: 1.7 (lowest since diagnosis) |
| Feb 5 | Dr. Tan reviews Guardant results: no actionable alterations. Discusses indeterminate lung nodule. After discussion, **patient chooses to proceed with FOLFOX.** |
| Feb 5 | **mFOLFOX6 started (without panitumumab)** — Dr. Tan's assessment says patient chose option 2 (FOLFOX alone). Panitumumab held in reserve per New EPOC trial evidence: anti-EGFR worsens outcomes in resectable/NED setting. Anti-EGFR to be deployed if unresectable recurrence develops. |
| Feb 11 | **Guardant 360 Tissue + Tissue RNA ordered** from Dec 2025 liver specimen — results pending |
