## I. Botensilimab + Balstilimab (BOT/BAL) — The MSS CRC Immunotherapy Breakthrough

**Why this matters**: This is the first immunotherapy combination showing meaningful
responses in MSS colorectal cancer, which represents >95% of all CRC and has been
essentially immune-therapy-resistant until now.

### Results (ESMO GI 2025)
- **42% two-year survival** in refractory MSS mCRC
- **20% objective response rate** (confirmed)
- **69% disease control rate**
- **16.6 months median duration of response**
- **20.9 months median overall survival**

### How it works
- **Botensilimab**: Next-generation anti-CTLA-4 antibody with enhanced Fc function —
  "kick-starts" the immune system against cold tumors
- **Balstilimab**: Anti-PD-1 antibody — sustains the immune response
- Together they aim to convert immunologically "cold" MSS tumors into "hot" ones

### Trial status
- **BATTMAN trial (CCTG CO.33)**: Phase 3 registration trial
- FDA agreed to waive monotherapy arm → simplified 2-arm design
- Enrollment began Q4 2025
- This is the most important upcoming trial for MSS CRC patients

### Eligibility considerations for this patient
- **Favorable**: MSS, prior systemic therapy, good PS
- **Potentially unfavorable**: Active liver metastases history (expanded cohort data
  specifically showed benefit in patients "with no active liver metastases" — and
  this patient is currently NED in liver)
- **Timing**: This would be a later-line option if current mFOLFOX6/panitumumab
  regimen fails

## II. ctDNA-Guided Anti-EGFR Strategies

### CITRIC Trial (ESMO 2025)
The first randomized study validating ctDNA-guided anti-EGFR rechallenge:
- Cetuximab + irinotecan vs. irinotecan alone in patients with RAS/BRAF/EGFR-ECD
  wild-type ctDNA
- **78% disease control rate** vs. 44% for irinotecan alone
- **4.64 months PFS** vs. 2 months

### PARERE Trial (2025-2026)
- First large randomized trial showing ctDNA-guided anti-EGFR monotherapy rechallenge
  superiority over regorafenib
- Panitumumab rechallenge with no detectable resistance on ctDNA

### CHRONOS Trial
- Established the concept of ctDNA-guided panitumumab rechallenge
- Published in Nature Medicine

### Relevance to this patient
Since panitumumab is being used for the first time now (not a rechallenge), these
trials are more relevant for **future treatment planning**. If the current
mFOLFOX6/panitumumab regimen is stopped and disease later progresses, ctDNA-guided
anti-EGFR rechallenge would be a validated later-line strategy.

## III. ctDNA/MRD-Guided Adjuvant Therapy Decisions

### CIRCULATE-Japan GALAXY (Liver Metastases Subgroup)
This is directly relevant — it studied ctDNA-guided adjuvant chemotherapy
specifically in patients with resected colorectal liver metastases:
- **190 patients** with surgically resected colorectal liver metastases
- ctDNA positivity in MRD window: **32.1%**
- In MRD-positive group: adjuvant chemo improved 24-month DFS
- **In MRD-negative group: NO benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy**

### Implications for this patient
The GALAXY data suggests that for MRD-negative patients (tumor fraction <0.05%),
adjuvant chemotherapy may not provide benefit. However:
- Dr. Tan chose to proceed with mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab anyway
- The rationale may be the indeterminate lung nodule — if it IS metastatic,
  this is active treatment rather than adjuvant
- Also, the positive margin on segment 2 resection increases local recurrence risk
- The Guardant Tissue test is pending and may change the calculus

### DYNAMIC-III Trial
- Phase 2/3 trial of ctDNA-guided adjuvant therapy in stage III colon cancer
- ctDNA-negative patients received de-escalated therapy
- Did NOT meet non-inferiority for 3-year recurrence-free survival
- Suggests caution about de-escalating treatment based on ctDNA alone

## IV. PARP Inhibitors for BRCA1-Methylated CRC — DEPRIORITIZED

### Key finding: Tempus xT HRD Score 23/50 — NOT Deficient

The Tempus xT tissue + RNA analysis (July 2025) shows **HRD score 23 (threshold 50)**,
meaning the tumor is NOT homologous recombination deficient despite BRCA1 promoter
methylation detected by Guardant360.

### Implications
- BRCA1 methylation is NOT creating a functional "BRCAness" phenotype in this tumor
- Single-agent PARP inhibitors are **unlikely to benefit** (olaparib showed limited
  activity even in HR-proficient CRC)
- Cross-sensitivity with oxaliplatin remains relevant (patient tolerates FOLFOX well)
- The pending Guardant Tissue + RNA from Dec 2025 liver specimen may show different
  HRD status in the more recent metastasis, but this is unlikely to change

### Residual relevance
- If HRD status changes in future testing, PARP inhibitors could be reconsidered
- Combination strategies (PARP + checkpoint + anti-VEGF) showed responses in BRCA2
  germline CRC regardless of HRD score — but this patient has somatic methylation, not
  germline mutation

## V. Tislelizumab + Cetuximab + Irinotecan (MSS, RAS-WT)

A single-arm phase 2 study published in Nature Communications (2024):
- Anti-PD-1 (tislelizumab) + anti-EGFR (cetuximab) + irinotecan
- Specifically for **refractory MSS, RAS wild-type mCRC**
- This combination attacks from two angles: immune checkpoint + EGFR pathway

### Relevance
This would be a later-line option if current therapy fails. The RAS-WT + MSS
profile makes this patient eligible for studies combining checkpoint + anti-EGFR.

- [Tislelizumab + Cetuximab + Irinotecan (Nature Communications)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51536-x)

## VI. Anti-EGFR Maintenance Strategies

### VALENTINO Trial
- Phase II trial: panitumumab maintenance ± 5-FU/LV after FOLFOX/panitumumab induction
- Panitumumab monotherapy maintenance did NOT meet non-inferiority
- **Implication**: When the time comes to consider maintenance (after completing
  mFOLFOX6/panitumumab induction), panitumumab + 5-FU/LV is preferred over
  panitumumab alone

### PARADIGM Trial Data
- Panitumumab + mFOLFOX6 vs. bevacizumab + mFOLFOX6 in first-line RAS-WT mCRC
- OS benefit for panitumumab in left-sided tumors (HR 0.82)
- This is the foundational evidence supporting the current regimen choice

## VII. Siteman Cancer Center / Washington University Resources

Dr. Tan and the Siteman team have access to:
- One of the largest cancer clinical trial programs in the Midwest (2799 patients
  enrolled in 600+ trials in 2022)
- Liver multidisciplinary conference (already being used for this patient)
- [Siteman Cancer Center Clinical Trials Search](https://siteman.wustl.edu/treatment/clinical-trials/)
- [WashU Division of Oncology Clinical Research](https://oncology.wustl.edu/research/clinical/)

### Recommended search filters for trial matching:
- Condition: Colorectal cancer, metastatic
- Molecular: MSS, RAS wild-type
- Features: BRCA methylation, MRD-negative, liver metastases resected
- Phase: 2 or 3
- Status: Recruiting

## VIII. Emerging Approaches (Not Yet in Trials for This Profile)

### Cancer Vaccines for CRC
- Therapeutic cancer vaccines are an active research area
- mRNA-based personalized neoantigen vaccines (similar to mRNA-4157 for melanoma)
  are being explored for CRC
- Low TMB (2.2) may limit neoantigen vaccine approaches

### Bispecific Antibodies
- Bispecific T-cell engagers targeting CRC-associated antigens
- Still early-phase for MSS CRC

### Hepatic Arterial Infusion (HAI) Pump
- Discussed by Dr. Tan in Sept 2024 notes
- Was deferred in favor of systemic therapy + surgical resection
- Would be reconsidered if liver-only recurrence develops
- Memorial Sloan Kettering has the most experience with HAI for CRC liver mets
